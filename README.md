## Protein-Interaction-Classifier

This repository contains documentation, scripts, and RMP (Rapid Miner Process) files relevant to protein classification. The objective of this project is to utilize data science knowledge to define a classifier. That classifier is expected to look at protein sequences and determine if the protein interacts with DNA or RNA. Providing useful insight to researchers in this field of study.
